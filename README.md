# UML

## UML class diagrams
The `Unified Modeling Language (UML)` is a language for software design that uses different types of diagrams to visualize the structure and behavior of programs. A `structural diagram` visualizes static elements of software, such as the variables and methods used in the program. A `behavioral diagram` visualizes dynamic behavior of software, such as the flow of an algorithm.

A UML `class diagram` is a structural diagram that can be used to visually model the classes of a computer program, including member variables and methods.

## UML class diagrams show class names, members, types, and access.
